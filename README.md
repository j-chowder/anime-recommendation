# To-Do List

### Front-End
[] drop-down menu that allows you to change search query --> i.e. Genre --> Psychological or Anime --> Fruits Basket or MyAnimeList user.
[] Search bar.. Maybe add an autocomplete search feature? i.e. "Fruits" would have dropdown to autofill "Fruits Basket".
[] Work on the router... after the user finishes input, take them to the recommendation page. On the recommendation page, has header to go back to homepage.
[] Design... Maybe have one of those image backgrounds? Or something more minimalist. I at least want to make it look decent.
